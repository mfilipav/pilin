## Rational Vaccine Design against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by ilmm Molecular Dynamics 

P. aeruginosa is a common bacteria that infects thousands of hospital visitors each year. It attaches to host cell membrane via a Type IV PAK pili, which is an oligomer of the 144 amino acid long long monomer protein. Here we show the development of the first-in-class small peptide vaccine targeting P. aeruginosa pilin epitope. The antigenic epitope spans 15 residues, and it was stabilized by performing a series of full length protein truncations and mutations at key salt-bridge forming residues, followed by exhaustive MD simulations with ilmm. The final product design (ID3) is only 50 amino acids long, exhibits stable secondary structure, minimized non-native interactions, and sub-angstrom RMSD and RMSF values at the binding epitope.
